# stage0 live-run re-verification report — 13 .hexa files

- Date: 2026-04-14
- Binary: `~/core/hexa-lang/build/hexa_stage0` (arm64 Mach-O, 1.8 MB, mtime 21:52)
- Execution mode: direct invocation of `hexa_stage0 <path>` interpreter
- Timeout: perl alarm 30 s (substitute for missing macOS `timeout`)
- Purpose: take the 13 files previously logged as "runtime.c missing → parse only" in past P1~P3 sessions and actually run them through the stage0 interpreter, capturing output/verification.

## Important correction — "parse only" → "stage0 live run"

Past artifacts stated "hexa runtime.c missing → parse-only verification"; this was a misjudgment.
The cause was a bug in the old stage1 `hexa build` path; the **stage0 interpreter/run mode worked correctly from the start**.
This report captures the actual stage0 run results for those 13 files. All prior wording of "parse only" in existing docs should be replaced with "stage0 live-run result".

Stats: 13/13 files executed successfully under stage0 (rc=0), zero errors. Of these, 12 files produced println output; 1 file (#4) has no main-body println by design (expected empty output).

### Execution classification

- Class A (6/13): bottom of the file already contains a `main()` call, so a single `hexa_stage0 <path>` invocation naturally emits all output (1,2,3,5,6 + 4; though #4 is intentionally silent).
- Class B (7/13): `fn main()` is defined but the bottom-of-file `main()` call is absent. Because the stage0 interpreter does not auto-invoke `main()`, running the original file yields 0 stdout lines. For the report we appended a single `\nmain()\n` line to a temporary copy and re-ran; this is marked as harness execution. The original files were not modified.

## Failed files — none

Of the 13 files, 0 produced stderr output or parse/runtime errors. Every file runs cleanly under the stage0 interpreter.

## Recommended follow-ups

1. For the 7 Class-B files (missing `main()` call), append a single `main()` line at the bottom of the originals.
2. Blanket-update docs and comments that say "parse verification only" / "runtime.c missing" to "stage0 live-run OK".
3. For file #4 arch_unified.hexa, recommend adding one println line exposing the main return `total` for verification visibility.
